Reflection Questions
-- After completing the joins, reflect on the following:

1) How does joining tables help you get a fuller picture of customer orders and product information?
     - I further understand what how it is for when mutiple people to buy the same thing and how thats tracked down from the database side.
       
2) Which joins were most challenging to understand? Why?
     - FULL JOIN is also a bit confusing since it includes all matches plus any rows that donâ€™t match, which can lead to a lot of empty null spaces in the results.
3) How could joining tables and using aggregations be useful for reporting in an e-commerce application?
   - Joining tables and using aggregations in e-commerce helps generate reports like total sales, average order value, and customer purchase frequency, offering insights for inventory and marketing.
